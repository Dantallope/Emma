        <h2>Reflection 1</h2>
        <p>In my research paper I explore the evolving security measures at Granite Bay High School and their impact on
            students, staff, and the learning environment. By analyzing policies such as security cameras, random drug
            searches, and enhanced locking mechanisms, the piece raises important questions about balancing safety and
            privacy. Through interviews, personal experiences, and critical analysis, it highlights the unintended
            consequences of these measures on student culture while advocating for mutual respect and transparent
            communication between faculty and students. This work reflects my belief in leading with purpose by
            emphasizing the need for thoughtful, student-centered policies that genuinely enhance safety without
            compromising trust. It also embodies inspiring through action by encouraging collaboration, open dialogue,
            and shared responsibility for creating a positive and secure educational community.</p>

        <h2>Reflection 2</h2>
        <p>In my reflection, I discuss the journey of discovering the importance of leading with a clear sense of
            purpose. I reflect on how setting intentions and being intentional with my actions has shaped my leadership
            style, allowing me to inspire others to take meaningful action. This connects to my life as I strive to be a
            leader who not only sets a strong example but also motivates others to act with intention and purpose.
            Through my experiences, Iâ€™ve learned that leadership is most impactful when driven by a clear purpose,
            inspiring positive change and action in those around me.</p>

        <h2>Reflection 3</h2>
        <p>In my research proposal, I examined the role of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices in
            supporting individuals with speech impairments. While AAC devices can significantly improve communication
            for those with speech challenges, I also recognized that they are not the only solution. Other forms of
            communication, such as non-verbal cues, sign language, and gestures, can play equally important roles in
            enhancing understanding and connection. My research proposal sought to explore how a combination of these
            communication methods can be most effective, ensuring that individuals have access to the tools that best
            meet their needs. By emphasizing the importance of diverse communication strategies, my research proposal
            encourages a thoughtful and inclusive approach to empowering individuals with speech impairments to
            communicate effectively and confidently. </p>
