    <h2>Short-Term Goals</h2>
    <p>In the short term, my goal is to continue developing as a coach and leader, focusing on strengthening my ability
      to motivate and guide athletes to achieve their personal and team goals. I have officially taken the head coach
      position at the high school team that I have been coaching for 5 years, and I hope to help rebuild the program
      into something that can be as successful as the years before it. I aim to build a strong, cohesive team culture
      that prioritizes discipline, teamwork, and continuous improvement. I also want to refine my skills in
      communication and conflict resolution to create an even more supportive environment where every individual -
      parents, admin, and athletes - feels heard and valued. Additionally, I plan to focus on expanding my network and
      gaining further professional development opportunities to enhance my expertise in both coaching and leadership.

    <h2>Long-Term Goals:</h2>
    <p>In the long term, my goal is to work for the Department of Education, where I can help shape educational policies
      and programs that support both students and educators. By 2026, I aim to take on leadership roles that allow me to
      influence positive change on a larger scale, ensuring that education systems are accessible, effective, and
      empowering. I plan to continue my education and certifications to deepen my expertise in educational leadership
      and policy development. Ultimately, I want to contribute to creating an inclusive, growth-oriented educational
      environment where all students, parents and educators have the resources and support they need to succeed.</p>
