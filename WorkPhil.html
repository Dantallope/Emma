        <h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
        <p>I believe that effective leadership is grounded in purpose, and the best way to inspire others is through
            intentional action. Whether I'm coaching a swim team, collaborating with colleagues, or handling individual
            tasks, I focus on clear goals and maintaining a strong work ethic. I lead by example, knowing that every
            action I take has an impact on those around me.
            Through my coaching experience and my time at Starbucks, I’ve learned the importance of creating supportive,
            team-oriented environments where individuals feel empowered to grow and excel. Both roles taught me the
            value of communication, resilience, and maintaining a positive attitude, especially in high-pressure
            situations. I’ve learned how to balance leading with empathy and holding others accountable, ensuring that
            everyone feels valued and motivated to contribute their best.
            I believe that great leadership involves setting clear expectations and holding others accountable while
            also offering the support needed to help them succeed. I foster an atmosphere of open communication, where
            individuals are encouraged to take ownership of their work and grow from both their successes and
            challenges. By leading with purpose and inspiring through action, I believe we can achieve personal growth,
            collective success, and create an environment where everyone thrives.
