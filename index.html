            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Emma Hansen and I am a recent college graduate with my B.S. in Family Studies and Human Development.
                I pride myself on being someone who values human connection and I strive to connect with people in all aspects of my life.
                I am currently a Starbucks barista and head swim coach of Granite Bay High School.
                I connect with people during their daily morning routine and have maintained relationships with my regulars for the past five years that I have worked at Starbucks.
                The swim team that I coach is the high school program that I also graduated from. The previous head coach of the swim team has been my coach since I was eight-years-old.
                I was given the opportunity to become head coach last year which has allowed me to develop and nurture the program that I grew up in. 
                Some of My student-athletes have also been coached by me since they were four. I value this team and my ability to maintain long term relationships with my community.
